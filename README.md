## Overview

This developer portfolio has been completely reimagined and built from the ground up to reflect my skills and creativity. It utilizes modern technologies and design principles to deliver a responsive, interactive, and scalable platform for showcasing my work.

### Features

- **Interactive 3D Design**: Integrated 3D elements using Spline to create an engaging experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for performance across all devices using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Implemented smooth, visually appealing transitions using Framer Motion.
- **Resume Integration**: A downloadable PDF of my resume is available directly from the portfolio using React PDF.
- **Modular and Extendable**: Designed for easy updates and expansion to accommodate future projects and features.

### Ongoing Improvements

- Further adjustments to the 3D elements, including potential removal of the robot.
- Exploration of adding a blog section.
- General refinements and optimizations for a more polished user experience.
